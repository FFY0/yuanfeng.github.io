I earned my bachelor’s degree in the School of Software Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2022. The same year, I was admitted to the School of Computer Science and Technology at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) to pursue a master’s degree, and in 2024, I transitioned to the PhD program. Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate jointly supervised by Prof. [Prof. Xike Xie](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xkxie/), [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. MingJun Xiao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiaomj/indexEN.html), and I am affiliated with the Data Darkness Lab (DDL) under the ([MIRACLE Center](https://miracle.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm)).

My research journey began with an exploration into understanding and leveraging the memory within neural networks to accomplish intriguing tasks. In addition, I am delving into the KV Cache memory mechanisms of LLMs, with the objective of unraveling their intrinsic workings and making application contributions like optimizing inference efficiency.

**Please don’t hesitate to reach out for any discussion. You can contact me via email at yfung@mail dot ustc dot edu dot cn. I am always open to engaging in intriguing research endeavors! 😊**

🎯 **Understanding KV Cache Memory in LLMs And Compressing them!**

1. Ada-KV: Optimizing kv cache eviction by adaptive budget allocation for efficient llm inference. **(Available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550))**
  
    *We introduced the first head-wise adaptive cache compression and open-sourced our code. [**CloudFlare**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/making-workers-ai-faster/) has integrated our Ada-KV algorithm into vLLM, providing crucial support for real-world deployment, and released a [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00161) with detailed evaluation. Additionally, we’ve been invited by **Huawei** and **OPPO** to share our insights with their teams, aiding in practical applications!  We also actively collaborating with the community, hoping to assist future research in this area.
